# Data: liga2015
# =====================================================
# For this session we'll be using the dataset that 
# comes in the file 'liga2015.csv' (see github repo)
# This dataset contains basic statistics from the
# Spanish soccer league during the season 2014-2015

# Read the data 
library(readr)

# Let's start with the rutinary inspection
# Check the data structure with str()
str(sc)

# how many rows in the dataset?
nrow(sc)

# how many columns in the dataset?
ncol(sc)

# names of columns
names(sc)
